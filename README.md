# Uninformed-Search-Algorithms-Analysis
Design analysis of various tree search algorithms. The documentation starts with the theoretical description of the algorithms in terms of *Completeness*, *Spatial complexity*, *Temporal complexity* and *Optimality*, followed by an analysis of the performance of the algorithms in finding a path on a graph built from the "roadNet-CA-weighted" dataset (California road network). 
Specifically:  
- BFS Breadth First search
- DFS Depth Dirst search
- DJKT Dijkstra's algorithm
- DLS Depth Limited Search
- IDS Iterative Deeping Search

In the program, attention is paid to the differences between the various algorithms in terms of:  
- Number of Iterations
- Length of the route
- Memory Usage
- Execution Time
